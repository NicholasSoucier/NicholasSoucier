Hello! I'm Nicholas Soucier!
I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas.
I am also a Student Assitant at a Technology and Facilities Services office at UTD. 

I'm constantly trying to learn and improve on emerging technology and programming skills / design tactics.
My hope is to make my page a place to hold a portfolio of all my past and current projects, where I can show my progress as a computer scientist,
and I can hopefully inspire others with my work. 

All of my projects are open-source and are available to use as wanted. Feel free to make revisions and reach out to me with what improvements you've made!
I love seeing how projects can be improved and optimised. 

My goals are to become a software engineer and establish a solid career for myself. I want to one day collaborate on an important project
that'll benefit the lives of the people around me.
